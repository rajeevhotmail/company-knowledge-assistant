Role: Technical Solutions Architect 	 Period: May 2009 –Aug 12
Description:  The work involves writing prototype applications, writing technical specification documents for development projects, reviewing high and low level design documents for engineering department, requirements gathering and pre-sales support.
Notable achievement in this role: 1. I wrote a prototype GGSN which has Gi, Gn and Gp interfaces.
2. Using TAPI wrote an application to identify Calling Party Number.

Role: Project Manager, Designer, Team Lead and programmer 	Period: April 98 - May 2009
Description:  I designed and managed development of Roaming Management Server (RMS) - a solution which allows network operator A to use bilateral agreements of operator B. RMS is based on dual MSISDN and dual IMSI on a single SIM card. A subscriber is “always present” through both the MSISDNs for both voice and SMS calls. As a result of dual MSISDN, international roaming calls are cheaper to subscribers.
MAP provider layer of RMS is built directly over TCAP layer. A RMS service comprises two or more MAP services.
The product is running for GlobalSim in PCM network of USA.
